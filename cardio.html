    <p>🫀 How the Heart Works<br>
        Your heart has its own "spark plug" — a part called the SA node that tells it when to beat.<br>
        
        Another part, the AV node, acts like a traffic light — it slows things down for a moment so the heart can fill <br>with blood properly before it pumps.
        
        The heart has its own blood supply too, called coronary arteries.<br> If one gets blocked, that’s what causes a heart attack.
        
        ❤️ Heartbeats and the ECG (Heart Tracing)<br>
        When the heart beats, it sends out tiny electrical signals.<br>
        
        A P wave on an ECG means the top chambers (the atria) are contracting.<br>
        
        The big spike (QRS) shows the bottom chambers (the ventricles) squeezing the blood out.<br>
        
        The T wave is the heart resetting itself to beat again.<br>
        
        If the rhythm is too slow, too fast, or irregular, the ECG helps catch that.<br>
        
        
        🚨 Common Heart Problems<br>
        Heart attack: Happens when a heart artery gets blocked. One kind (STEMI) is more severe and shows clear signs on an ECG.<br>
        
        Heart failure: When the heart can’t pump well enough. <br>It can either be too weak (reduced ejection fraction) or too stiff (preserved ejection fraction).
        
        <br>Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The top chambers flutter instead of beating normally. You might feel your heart race or skip.<br>
        
        High blood pressure: Silent but dangerous — can damage the heart over time.<br>
        
        Pericarditis: Inflammation of the heart’s lining, often hurts more when lying flat.<br>
        
        🧪 Important Blood Tests<br>
        Troponin: Tells us if there’s been heart muscle damage (like in a heart attack).<br>
        
        BNP: High levels mean the heart is stretched — a sign of heart failure.<br>
        
        LDL cholesterol: The lower, the better — under 70 is ideal for people with heart disease.<br>
        
        CRP: A general marker of inflammation — higher means higher heart risk.</p>
